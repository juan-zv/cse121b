places.Bolivia = "4 years";
places.Spain = "14 years";

// Step 9: Add additional objects with the same properties for each place you've lived


/* OUTPUT */

document.querySelector("#photo").src = myself.photo;

// Step 3: Assign the value of the name property as the alt attribute of the HTML <img> element with an ID of photo

document.getElementById("photo").alt = myself.name;

// Step 4: For each favorite food in the favoriteFoods property, create an HTML <li> element and place its value in the <li> element

for (let i = 0; i < myself.favoriteFoods.length; i++) {
    var li = document.createElement("li");
    document.getElementById("favorite-foods").innerHTML = myself.favoriteFoods[i];
}

// Step 5: Append the <li> elements created above as children of the HTML <ul> element with an ID of favorite-foods
